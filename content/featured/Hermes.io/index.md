I made this project to experiment and learn about Websockets after I had some experience with backend tech stacks

Hermes.io is a real-time chat application with chat room system. Some minor functionalities include autoscrolling with new messages and stopping the autoscrolling on user interference. You can join any chatroom and see the members on the left. Admin is the system that notifies about the arrival or exit of any user.
